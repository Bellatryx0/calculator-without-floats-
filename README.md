# calculator-WITH-floats
Learning really basic java, the name says it all, thanks.
Made with cmd and javac because it's the best I can do.

It's java (duh).
Make sure you have it installed. Then:
```bash
javac calculator.java
java calculator
```
(one line at a time)

Does floats! Waow. AND with comma and dot support. (impressive)

WIP: *do something. prolly adding parenthesis support, dunno.*
