# calculator-WITH-floats
Learning really basic java, the name says it all, thanks.
Made with cmd and javac because it's the best I can do.

# Features
 - Supports the four basic mathematical operators.
 - WOrks with floats and accepts both ```,```and ```.``` for decimals.
 - Handles invalid outputs with ```try-catch``` blocks.
 - Prevents division by 0 (wow).
# What I learned.
 - Reading user input with ```Scanner```.
 - Basic syntax, the need to import.
 - Using ```switch-case``` statements for operators.
 - Handling exceptions(```InputMismatchException```, ```ArithmeticException```, ```Exception```)

It's java (duh).
Make sure you have it installed. Then:
```bash
javac calculator.java
java calculator
```
(one line at a time)

Does floats! Waow. AND with comma and dot support. (impressive)

WIP: *do something. prolly adding parenthesis support, dunno.*
